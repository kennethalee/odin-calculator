# Odin Calculator

This project is a simple web-based calculator created as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It was designed to strengthen my front-end development skills using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Feel free to check out the project [live](https://kennethalee.github.io/odin-calculator/)

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Chained Operations**: Continue calculations without restarting the calculator.
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset the calculator and start fresh.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Buttons**: User-friendly interface with clickable buttons for numbers and operators.

## Tools

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Objective

Create a calculator that:

- Strengthens understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Insights

- Learned to handle user input dynamically and efficiently.
- Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions, scope, and conditionals.
- Encountered and resolved challenges in managing operator precedence and chained operations.
- Enhanced my CSS layout skills

## Future Plans

- Add support for more advanced operations (e.g., square roots, percentages).
- Include a memory feature to store and recall previous calculations.
- Refactor code to improve readability and scalability.

## Personal Thoughts

- It was initially challenging to manage variables and logics, but debugging these issues was an excellent learning experience.
- Overall, this project was both educational and enjoyable. Iâ€™m proud of the progress Iâ€™ve made and excited to continue improving this project.
